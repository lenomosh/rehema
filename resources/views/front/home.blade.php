                        respective forms. The class level positions comprise of the class prefects who are in charge of
                        their respective classes and are answerable to their respective form captains. All the positions
                        are elective and the holders serve for a one-year term.<br/>
                        The school elections are held at the beginning of each year. Only form three students are
                        eligible for school level positions. The school level prefects are elected by all the students
                        in the school. A form level captain is elected by all the students in the streams in his/her own
                        form. A class prefect is elected by members of his/her own class (stream).<br/>
                        Students who intend to vie for the positions are required to be vetted by the school
                        administration. The successful candidates are required to provide their personal details which
                        would be used in the ballot papers. The school level and the form level contestants (candidates)
                        are vetted by the school administration, while the class level contestants are vetted by their
                        respective class teachers. One of the requirements in the vetting is that each contestant must
                        have been<br/>
                        proposed and seconded by their electorate (students). Those seeking school level positions are
                        required to be seconded by a student from each class in their respective forms. Those seeking
                        class level positions are required to be seconded by two students from their respective classes.<br/>
                        Voting is carried out in every classroom concurrently, where the respective class teacher
                        presides over the exercise. On the day of voting, the class teachers collect ballot papers for
                        each of the elective positions for their respective classes. During voting, students are
                        required to indicate their preference on the ballot papers by placing a tick (&radic;) against
                        the candidate of their choice and inserting the ballot papers in their respective ballot
                        boxes.<br/>
                        Counting of votes is carried out in the respective classes and the results are recorded,
                        announced and taken to a tallying centre. At the tallying centre, the form level and the school
                        level vote results from the classes are combined and the total votes for each candidate
                        recorded.<br/>
                        The candidate with the highest number of votes for each post is declared the winner. The results
                        of the election are forwarded to the school principal who then approves and announces the final
                        results.</p>
